# Contributing Guidelines

If you are new to Git/GitHub, read this [guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

**Rule:** Never commit directly to master.

### How do I make a contribution?
Assuming you have already cloned the repository locally,

1. Checkout a new branch with a descriptive and succinct name
2. Push this branch to the remote for everyone to see that you are working on it
3. Make any changes and commits to this branch
4. Open a Pull Request
5. Ask a team member to review it before merging

### Other caveats

* Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* Add appropriate tags to the Pull Request
