# Pi in the Sky
A simple Raspberry Pi based home server.

The end goal of this project is a simple home server that requires minimal setup. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as cloud storage, automated backups, web hosting, etc. It will include tools to help the end user set up a home server with almost zero technical knowledge on their part. The server will also be accessible outside of the userâ€™s home network through an admin dashboard.
